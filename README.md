## Problems Building Botcher
Sometimes pods get screwed up in this repository and may cause this project to fail while building. A fix for your local machine would be to delete the ```pods``` folder and ```Botch.xcworkspace```, then do ```pod install``` in terminal. If your issue with pods still persists, open an issue on Github.
